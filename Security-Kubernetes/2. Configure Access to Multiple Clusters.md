### KubeConfig File :

A file that is used to configure access to a cluster is sometimes called a kubeconfig file. This is a generic way of referring to configuration files. It does not mean that there is a file named kubeconfig.
you can quickly switch between clusters by using the kubectl config use-context command


```sh
kubectl get pods 
    --server my-kube-playground:6443
    --client-key admin.key
    --client-certificate admin.crt
    --certificate-autority ca.crt
```


to do that by default sore those information in a KubeConfig File under $HOME/.kube/config
    --server my-kube-playground:6443
    --client-key admin.key
    --client-certificate admin.crt
    --certificate-autority ca.crt

is in a specific format 

clusters : Developement , production,Google 
Context : Admin@Production, Dev@Google ( that's mean Developper can do a deployement on google )
users : Admin,Dev User , Prod User

a yaml file :

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
current-context: development@developer
clusters:
- cluster:
  name: development
- cluster:
  name: scratch
users:
- name: developer
- name: experimenter
contexts:
- context:
  name: development@developer

- context:
  name: scratch@experimenter
```



to view an actual context config file : 

```sh 
kubectl config view 
```

```sh
to change a actual context : kubectl config use-context scratch@experimenter
```

example :


to see a specific config file my-kube-config that has been created just do this : 

```sh
kubectl config view --kubeconfig my-kube-config
```

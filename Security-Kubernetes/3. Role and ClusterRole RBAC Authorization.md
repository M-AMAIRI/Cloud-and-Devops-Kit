### Role and ClusterRole

An RBAC Role or ClusterRole contains rules that represent a set of permissions. 

- A Role always sets permissions within a particular namespace; when you create a Role, you have to specify the namespace it belongs in.

- ClusterRole, is a non-namespaced resource. The resources have different names (Role and ClusterRole) because a Kubernetes object always has to be either namespaced or not namespaced.

 ==> If you want to define a role within a namespace, use a Role; if you want to define a role cluster-wide, use a ClusterRole.


#### Role example

Role Based Access Controls :

example :

1. a role for developer

```yaml

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: developer
rules:
- apiGroups: [""] # "" indicates the core API group
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
  #ressourceName: ["blue","orange"] # to give a access for the developper just for orange and blue pod

```


to create a role by using : ``` kubectl create -f developer-role.yaml ```

2. To link a user to a rule :

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: developer
  namespace: default    // all the role and the role binding is created to a default namespace
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: jane 
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role #this must be Role or ClusterRole
  name: developer
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```
and to create that : ``` kubectl create -f developer-role-binding.yaml ```


some command :
```sh
kubectl get roles
kubectl get rolebindings
kubectl describe roles/rolebindings
```

to check :  ``` kubectl auth can-i create deployements --as dev-user ```

or :  ``` kubectl auth can-i create deployements --as dev-user --namespace test ```



ClusterRole example :

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  # "namespace" omitted since ClusterRoles are not namespaced
  name: secret-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  #
  # at the HTTP level, the name of the resource for accessing Secret
  # objects is "secrets"
  resources: ["secrets"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
  ```
  
ClusterRole Binding :

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
# This role binding allows "jane" to read pods in the "default" namespace.
# You need to already have a Role named "pod-reader" in that namespace.
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods
  namespace: default
subjects:
# You can specify more than one "subject"
- kind: User
  name: jane # "name" is case sensitive
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  # "roleRef" specifies the binding to a Role / ClusterRole
  kind: Role #this must be Role or ClusterRole
  name: pod-reader # this must match the name of the Role or ClusterRole you wish to bind to
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```
  
  
#### example :
A new user michelle joined the team. She will be focusing on the nodes in the cluster. Create the required ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings so she gets access to the nodes.

```yaml
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: node-admin
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["nodes"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list", "create", "delete"]

---
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: michelle-binding
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: michelle
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: node-admin
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.iomaster
```
  
Now michelle's responsibilities are growing and now she will be responsible for storage as well. Create the required ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings to allow her access to Storage.

```yaml
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: storage-admin
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["persistentvolumes"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list", "create", "delete"]
- apiGroups: ["storage.k8s.io"]
  resources: ["storageclasses"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list", "create", "delete"]

---
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: michelle-storage-admin
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: michelle
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: storage-admin

```
